Please represent the answer in the format (pile, number of stones taken), for example, if it is thought that one should first take $$3$$ stones from pile $$B$$, the answer should be $$(B,3)$$; if it is thought that one should first take $$1$$ stone from pile $$C$$, the answer should be $$(C,1)$$; and if it is thought that one should first take $$3$$ stones from pile $$C$$, the answer should be $$(C,3)$$, and so on...",
