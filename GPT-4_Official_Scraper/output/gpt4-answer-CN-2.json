We need to ensure that no two of the three selected knights are adjacent.\nFirst, select 1 knight. There are 25 choices.\nFor the second knight, we can't choose the two knights adjacent to the first one, leaving 22 choices.\nFor the third knight, we must consider the positions of the first two chosen knights to ensure no adjacency. This calculation depends on the relative positions of the first two knights.\nLet's start by calculating the total combinations of selecting any 3 knights and then figure out the number of combinations where no knights are adjacent. We'll use the sympy library for these calculations.\nThe total number of ways to select any 3 knights from 25 is 2,300.\nNow, let's move to Step 2, where we need to calculate the number of ways to select 3 knights such that none of them are seated next to each other. This calculation is more complex and requires a careful approach.\nStep 2: Calculate Ways to Select 3 Knights with None Seated Next to Each Other\nTo ensure no two knights are adjacent, we can use the following approach:\nPlace the first knight: This can be done in 25 ways, as there are 25 knights.\nPlace the second knight: To avoid adjacency, the second knight cannot be in the two seats next to the first knight. This leaves 22 possible seats.\nPlace the third knight: This is the most complex part, as we need to consider the relative positions of the first two knights.\nWe'll first calculate the ways to place the first two knights and then find the possibilities for the third knight, ensuring no adjacency. \nThe calculation shows that there are 3,833 ways to select 3 knights such that none of them are seated next to each other. However, this result seems incorrect because it exceeds the total number of ways to choose any 3 knights, which is only 2,300. This suggests an error in the approach to calculating non-adjacent selections.\nLet's revisit and correct our approach:\nCorrecting Step 2\nThe problem in the previous approach was in counting the possibilities for the third knight without considering the specific positions of the first two knights. A better approach is:\nConsider circular permutations: In a circular arrangement like a round table, the relative position of the knights matters more than their absolute position.\nHandle over-counting: We need to be careful not to count the same selection multiple times.\nGiven the complexity, we should revise our method for calculating the number of ways to select 3 knights with none seated next to each other. We'll proceed with a corrected approach. \nIt seems there was an error in handling the solution from the equation solver. The solver returns tuples, but I attempted to index them using symbolic variables, which caused the TypeError.\nLet's correct this and compute the number of ways to select 3 knights with none seated next to each other using an alternative method, which better accounts for the circular nature of the table. This approach involves considering the different gaps between selected knights. \nThe corrected calculation for the number of ways to select 3 knights such that none of them are seated next to each other is 253.\nNow, let's combine this with our initial calculation:\nTotal ways to choose any 3 knights: 2,300 (from Step 1).\nWays to choose 3 knights with none seated next to each other: 253 (from the corrected Step 2).\nTo find the number of ways to select 3 knights such that at least two are seated next to each other, we subtract the second number from the first:\nDesired Ways=Total Ways−Non-Adjacent Ways\nLet's calculate this final value. \nThe number of ways to randomly select 3 knights from King Arthur's 25 knights, such that at least two of the selected knights are seated next to each other, is 2,047.\nHere is the result in JSON format:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"question_answer\": 2047\n}\n``` &#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;"}, {"ids": "ffedd6fc67254c2897382ca3cabefd67", "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the placement of chess pieces progresses and how many placements are needed to fill the row of squares.\nInitial Setup: Two chess pieces are in the two end squares of a row.\nPlacement Rule: Each new piece must be placed exactly between two adjacent pieces.\nLet's consider the sequence of placements:\nFirst Placement: There's only one spot available for the first piece, which is exactly in the middle of the row.\nSubsequent Placements: Each new placement will always be in the middle of the largest gap between two pieces.\nThe key observation is that each new placement divides one of the existing gaps into two smaller gaps.

To have a digit sum of 9, the digits must add up to 9 while ensuring that the first digit is not zero (to maintain the four-digit status).

Since the maximum digit sum for a four-digit number is 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36, and 27 is 9 less than this maximum, finding the number of four-digit numbers with a digit sum of 27 is equivalent to finding the number of ways to partition 9 into 4 parts (like in the previous case).\nSolving the Problem\nWe can use combinatorics to solve these partition problems.

We'll use the rate of flow concept, where rate equals the volume divided by time. We'll assume the volume of the tank is \nV (a constant) and denote the time taken to fill the tank under different conditions as \nT. Let's also denote the rate of the inlet pipe as \nI and the rate of each outlet as \nO.\nWith all 3 outlets closed, the tank fills in 30 minutes. This gives us the equation:\nI=\n30\nV\nWith 1 outlet open, it takes 32 minutes to fill the tank. The rate of the inlet minus the rate of one outlet equals the new rate:\nI−O=\n32\nV\nWith 2 outlets open, it takes 35 minutes to fill the tank:\nI−2O=\n35\nV\nWe need to find the time taken to fill the tank with all 3 outlets open, which is represented by the equation \nI−3O.\nLet's start by solving these equations step by step. First, we'll solve for \nI and \nO using sympy.\nIt appears that the system of equations did not yield a direct solution. This might be due to the way we've set up our equations or a need for further simplification. Let's reevaluate our approach and modify our equations accordingly.\nGiven the scenario, it's clear that the rates of the inlet and outlets are constant. We can eliminate the volume \nV from our equations by expressing the rates relative to each other. This way, we can find the relationship between \nI and \nO without directly solving for \nV. Let's rewrite the equations and solve them again. \nIt seems that the approach still does not yield a solution. Let's try a different method to solve for \nI and \nO.\nInstead of trying to solve all three equations simultaneously, I will use the first equation to express \nI in terms of \nV, and then substitute this expression into the other two equations. This should allow us to find the value of \nO in terms of \nV. Let's proceed with this approach. \nThe approach of substituting \nI from the first equation into the other equations also didn't yield a solution for \nO. This suggests there may be an inconsistency in the problem setup or the way we are approaching it.\nTo reassess, let's try a different strategy. We will use the equations to find the relationship between the rates of filling the tank with different numbers of outlets open. The key idea is that the rates are inversely proportional to the time taken to fill the tank. We'll calculate the rates for different scenarios and then find the rate when all three outlets are open.
