Additionally, the sum of the numbers represented by the characters in each idiom is 21. We need to find the maximum possible value for the character '弄'.\nStep 1: Solve\nThe idioms are '虚有其表', '表里如一', '一见如故', and '故弄玄虚'.

The number of zeros at the end of a product is determined by the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in its prime factorization since \n10=2×5.\nStep 1: Solve\nTo have exactly 4 zeros, the product must contain exactly four pairs of 2s and 5s.

This suggests a pattern, but to find the exact value of the entire series, I'll continue the solve process by analyzing the series further.\nLet's examine the structure of each term more closely. Each term in the series is of the form \n2008×2007×⋯\n2010×2009×⋯\n, where the numerator and the denominator have the same number of terms, starting from 2010 and 2008 respectively. This structure hints at a simplification using factorials.\nI'll now express the terms in a more generalized form and look for a pattern. \nThe simplified terms of the series, represented using factorials, show an increasing complexity with each term. This increasing complexity in the terms suggests that the series might be telescoping or have a pattern that simplifies when summed up. However, the factorial representation in its current form doesn't immediately reveal a clear pattern.\nTo further analyze the series, I'll explore if there's a way to rewrite these terms in a form that might better reveal the overall structure of the series.

So, B is 61 years old in 2016.\nStep 2: Calculate B's Birth Year\nIf B is 61 years old in 2016, B was born in \n2016−61=1955.\nStep 3: Verify the Condition\nWe need to verify that the product of the last two digits of B's birth year (55) is indeed 61.

Let's proceed with the calculation and verification.\nThe verification reveals that the product of the last two digits of B's birth year (1955) is not equal to B's age in 2016.

It's reminiscent of a problem in combinatorial geometry or graph theory, possibly related to non-intersecting paths or non-crossing partitions.\nApproach\nWe'll approach this problem by considering it as a problem of pairing \n2n points into \nn pairs (arrows) with the given constraints. This is akin to finding non-crossing partitions of a set, often encountered in Catalan number problems.\nStep 1: Understanding the Constraints\nConstraint 1 and 2 imply that each point must be used exactly once, and arrows must be non-crossing.\nConstraint 3 implies a specific directional arrangement, which affects the count.\nStep 2: Deriving a Formula\nThis problem seems to be related to Catalan numbers, a sequence of natural numbers that have found applications in various combinatorial problems, such as counting the number of correct ways to bracket expressions, the number of rooted binary trees, and more.\nThe \nnth Catalan number is given by:\nC\nn\n=\nn+1\n1\n(\nn\n2n\n)\nWe need to check if this formula applies to our problem, considering the constraints.\nStep 3: Implementing the Solution\nWe'll use Python to calculate the Catalan number for a given \nn and check if it satisfies the constraints.\nLet's begin by implementing this solution.\nThe \nnth Catalan number is given by the formula \nn+1\n(\nn\n2n\n)\n. This formula calculates the number of ways to pair \n2n points into \nn non-crossing pairs (arrows) on a circle.\nStep 4: Verifying the Solution\nTo verify this solution, we must ensure that it satisfies all the given conditions. The Catalan number formulation inherently ensures non-crossing pairs, satisfying the first two conditions.\nHowever, the third condition, which prohibits certain directional arrangements of arrows, needs closer scrutiny. This condition might be inherently satisfied due to the nature of non-crossing partitions on a circle, but we should confirm this.\nStep 5: Confirming Applicability for Condition 3\nCondition 3 implies that for any four points \nA, \nB, \nC, and \nD positioned clockwise, we cannot have both \nAB\n and \nCD\n. The non-crossing nature of Catalan structures inherently prevents this arrangement, as such an arrangement would imply crossing arrows.\nConclusion\nThus, the number of ways to draw \nn straight arrows satisfying all conditions is given by the \nnth Catalan number.\nLet's output the result in JSON format. \nThe answer to the math problem is:\njson\nCopy code\n{\n  \"question_answer\": \"binomial(2*n, n)/(n + 1)\"\n}\nThis represents the number of ways to draw \nn straight arrows satisfying all the given conditions, calculated as the \nnth Catalan number.
