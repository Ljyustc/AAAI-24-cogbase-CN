This is because any multiple of 5 ends in 0 or 5, and the only prime number that ends in 5 is 5 itself, which is not a two-digit number. Since we cannot find a two-digit prime gas station, we need to reevaluate our approach.\nRevisiting the Problem Statement\nThe problem might imply that when Alpha and Gamma meet at a gas station with a two-digit prime number, Beta happens to arrive at a gas station numbered \na\n2\n, but this \na\n2\n station does not necessarily have to be the same two-digit prime number.\nNew Approach\nFind Suitable \na\n2\n Gas Stations: We need to find square numbers that can be gas station numbers and are less than 1000 (since the total distance is less than 1000 km).\nMatch with Two-Digit Prime Gas Stations: For each \na\n2\n gas station, check the distance at which Alpha and Gamma would meet. This meeting point should be a two-digit prime number.\nLet's start by identifying square number gas stations. \nWe have identified square number gas stations within 1000 kilometers: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, and 196.
